# PyScan

I had a bunch of old photos that I needed to scan using an HP ENVY AIO printer.

The embedded web interface of the ENVY printer is a bit lacking: e.g. doesn't offer enough pre-set scan sizes; requires extra clicks to save the uploaded photo from the browser.

Although I have both Linux and Windows PCs, I was reluctant to use the native scanning tools. When I used them before, I remember them being awkward to install and cumbersome or lacking to use.

So thatâ€™s why I wrote this python tool. Simple, quick and effective. Specialized for my environment, but could easily be generalized.
